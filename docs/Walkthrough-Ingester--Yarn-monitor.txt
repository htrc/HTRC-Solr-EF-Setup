Preamble
========

It is assumed you have already worked through:

  Walkthrough-Ingester--basic.txt

Walkthrough -- Yarn-monitor
===========================

The purpose of this walkthrough is to:

   (i) Run an ingest of Solr Extracted Feature JSON files on the Spark
       cluster, and then
  (ii) monitor its progress through the Hadoop/YARN
       web-browser dashboard

For (i) we need to ingest a slightly larger set of JSON files
than that done in 'Walkthrough-Ingester--basic.txt'.  We can
use the same basic command as before:

  ./JSONLIST-YARN-INGEST.sh

but will supply additional command-line arguments to it.

For (ii) we need to set up network entries that allow your host
computer to access the private network of the cluster computer
(gchead, gc1, etc).  The walkthrough starts with this part of the
setup first.

1. Network Hosts
================

The following assumes you are working from a Linux machine with admin
rights.  If not, then a useful alternative is to set up a VM on your
host machine in which to do the work.  This has been done successfully
using VirtualBox on a Windows PC running an Ubuntu 15.04 guest
machine, and is what the details below are based on.


Install the University of Illinois specific VPN client, if not already done so:

  https://techservices.illinois.edu/services/virtual-private-networking-vpn/download-and-set-up-the-vpn-client

Start the VPN client:

  /opt/cisco/anyconnect/bin/vpnui &

and connect to:

  vpn.cities.illinois.edu


Now edit your /etc/hosts file, so it contains the lines:

  192.168.64.1  gchead gchead-local
  192.168.64.18 gc0 gc0-local
  192.168.64.19 gc1 gc1-local
  192.168.64.20 gc2 gc2-local
  192.168.64.21 gc3 gc3-local
  192.168.64.22 gc4 gc4-local
  192.168.64.23 gc5 gc5-local
  192.168.64.24 gc6 gc6-local
  192.168.64.25 gc7 gc7-local
  192.168.64.26 gc8 gc8-local
  192.168.64.27 gc9 gc9-local

In your web-browser's proxy settings, make sure you have SOCKS_v5 set to:
  SOCKS Host: localhost
  Port: 9999

An Ubuntu distribution should have Firefox as an installed browser by default.

Then run:

  ssh -D 9999 <username>@gsliscluster1.lis.illinois.edu

substituting your Illinois username for <username>

Finally, visit:

  http://gchead:8088/cluster/

to see the Hadoop/YARN dashboard.

You should see something similar to the following snapshot:

2. Run an ingest
================

Similar to Walkthrough-Ingester--basic, create a collection on the
Solr cloud, this time with a collection name that reflects the fact
the we will be processing 32205 volumes (the full version of
Ted Underwood's Fiction workset v0.1)

  wget "http://solr1-s:8983/solr/admin/collections?action=CREATE&name=$USER-fict32205-htrc-baseline&numShards=20&replicationFactor=1&collection.configName=htrc_configs" -O -
 
Now start the ingest:

 ./JSONLIST-YARN-INGEST.sh $USER-fict32205-htrc-baseline htrc_configs 20 /user/dbbridge/fict-full-pairtree-ids.txt


And monitor its progress through:

  http://gchead:8088/cluster/
