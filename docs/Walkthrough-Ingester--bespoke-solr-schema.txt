Preamble

It is assumed you have already worked through:

Walkthrough -- Bespoke Solr config
==================================

The purpose of this walkthrough is to:

   (i) Create a custom solr configuration on the Solr Cloud
  (ii) Run an ingest of Solr Extracted Feature JSON files on the Spark
       cluster that makes use of it

For (i) we need to work directly on the server providing the Solr cloud

For (ii), as with other ingest walkthroughs, we need to work on the
Spark cluster, and will again make use of:

  ./JSONLIST-YARN-INGEST.sh

using its command-line arguments to specify the custom/bespoke
Solr config created in (i)

1. Solr Cloud
=============

Log in to the Solr cloud:

  ssh solr1.ischool.illinois.edu

And move to where the HTRC-EF-Solr-Setup is installed:

  cd $HTRC_NETWORK_HOME/

The original baseline Solr configset created for indexing/searching
the HTRC Extracted Features is called 'htrc-configs-baseline'
You will find it in the HTRC-EF-Solr-Setup 'conf' area:

  cd conf/solr7.2.1
  ls -l

See README-Solr-Schema.txt for details

To make a customized variation of this (say, that sets 'docval'
to be true for fields used by HTRC for indexing/searching)
start by making a copy of the configset directory:


  /bin/cp -r htrc-configs-baseline htrc-configs-<CUSTOMNAME>

where <CUSTOMNAME> would be changed to something like 'docval'
for the suggested example.

Edit the file:

  htrc-configs-<CUSTOMNAME>/conf/mananaged-schema

For example, making make the non-stored 'htrc' fields have the docval as true

Now return to the top-level HTRC-Solr-EF-Setup directory:

  cd ../..

And copy the custom Solr configset into the solr7 file hierarchy:

  /bin/cp -r conf/solr7.2.1/htrc-configs-<CUSTOMNAME> solr7/server/solr/configsets/.

This now needs to be pushed into Zookeeper so it is visible to all the
Solr instances running:

  solr zk upconfig -d solr7/server/solr/configsets/htrc-configs-<CUSTOMNAME> -n htrc-configs-<CUSTONNAME>  -z $ZOOKEEPER_SERVER


2. Run an ingest using the custom configset
===========================================


Create a collection (name of your choosing) with the configset you
have made

  wget "http://solr1-s:8983/solr/admin/collections?action=CREATE&name=$USER-fict1055-htrc-configs-<CUSTOMNAME>&numShards=4&replicationFactor=1&collection.configName=htrc-configs-<CUSTOMNAME>" -O -

Now start the ingest:

  ./JSONLIST-YARN-INGEST.sh $USER-fict1055-htrc-configs-<CUSTOMNAME> htrc-configs-<CUSTOMNAME>


This builds a small collection (based on the 1055 fict set).  If building a larger collection then
monitor its progress in the usual way:
